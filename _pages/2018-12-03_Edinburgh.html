      <div>
        The biggest challenge I face at J.P.Morgan's Glasgow Technology Hub is providing context-specific guidance to ~2000 software engineers in 300+ teams. This cannot be done effectively at scale on gut-feel or by following a
        rigid maturity model. So, building on Chris McDermott's Maturity Mapping paper and with Marc Burguer, we have been developing techniques to help teams to map their own maturity. We use this to help them gain situational
        awareness and to focus on which areas of improvement will be of most value to them. Once equipped with this information, we can deliver much more focused coaching and though their evolving maps, have the ability to judge how
        that has affected the team's maturity.

    <td><b>Liz Keogh - Cynefin for Mappers</b>
      <div>
        We know that when we map the journey of new ideas that survive, they move from genesis through their development as a product to their commoditisation and sometimes their eventual replacement... but how does that happen, and
        why is it inevitable? In this talk we look at the dynamics inherent in the Cynefin framework to show how fledgling ideas take flight, then take root; how to handle complex, uncertain situations; and why the close
        relationship between Wardley Mapping's and Cynefin's domains isn't quite as simple as it seems.

        This the story of a team of teams. A team of teams with a manager who reads on planes. Having come back from a recent conference, our fearless manager has defined a significant pivot in strategy, and has challenged our
        friendly team of teams to achieve a new vision for the business. How will our teams come to understand this strategy and its implications for how they and their software is organized? Come, listen to the tale of a team of
        teams, mapping their way through disruptive change.

    <td><b>Jabe Bloom - Three Cups of Tea with a Map: Having Conversations With Wardley Maps</b>
      <div>
        You've built a map. It's got red arrow strategies! And podular team structures have been identified!
        <br><br>
        What kind of conversations do you need to be having in order to operationalize these ideas in reality?
        <br><br>
        Join Jabe Bloom for Three Cups of Tea with a Map, we'll explore three potential conversations to have with teams centered on a map.
        <br><br>
        The 1st Cup of Tea - The 3 Economies & Prioritization. What does my map tell me about managing my portfolio and backlogs? How can I use economics to enable prioritization conversations using my map?
        <br><br>
        The 2nd Cup of Tea - Cost of Change. Your strategy, indicated by brilliant red arrows streaking across the evolutionary axis&hellip; yeah&hellip; so about that. How can mapping in terms of Cost of Change enable back briefing and a reality check on your best-laid plans?
        <br><br>
        The 3rd Cup of Tea - Conversation #3 Componentization and InterTeam Relationships. Ok&hellip; so your map may indicate that things are currently a bit of a jumble. How did we get into this tangle in the first place and how do we deal with Cost of Change in the future? Over the final cup of Tea, lets talk about the relationship between Componentization and InterTeam (Lateral) Relationships in heterogeneous organizational structures.
        <br><br>
        If you have a map you are willing to share&hellip; bring it!

    <td><b>Chris McDermott &amp; Marc Burgauer - Maturity Mapping : Focus your improvement energy on what matters</b>
      <div>
        When we look to improve our teams or our organisations we often reach for a maturity model. We'll start with an assessment that grades us and then offers a recipe to follow to greatness. It might tell us we don't visualise
        well enough or our stories aren't perfectly formed and what we should do to get better but does that really help us? Does it promote continuous learning and does it help us solve the real problems we are facing.
        <br><br>
        One of the issues with the maturity models we often use is they are context free. They don't understand the environment, the challenges and the specific needs we have in our context.
        <br><br>
        In this workshop Chris and Marc will introduce you to an alternative, Maturity Mapping, using Wardley Maps and Cynefin, that allows you to develop situational awareness and build a shared understanding of the unique
        challenges you face and where you should focus your improvement efforts.
        <br><br>
        You'll be presented with a scenario and then be guided through the process of producing a map. You'll then be made aware of a change and asked what elements of your map you'd move to meet the challenge.
