<p>
  This is our third Map Camp in London and it is kindly sponsored by the <a href="https://leadingedgeforum.com/">Leading Edge Forum</a>. Map Camp is a community run event, it consists of a series of lectures from renowned speakers with a coffee and networking area to meet other mappers from across the globe. We have a wonderful line up of speakers which will be announced shortly. The original event in 2017 was planned to be 30 people, we ended up with 180 and over 150 on a waiting list. In 2018, we planned for 350 people, we ended up with 450 and over 260 on a waiting list. This year, we have an even bigger venue in the hope that we might be able to accommodate everyone.
</p>

<p>
  Map Camp is a safe environment for all and we will do everything we can to make sure that it is. If you're planning on attending please read the <a href="/_pages/code_of_conduct/">code of conduct</a>.

<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>
  We will start publishing the schedule over the next few weeks. Early bird tickets are limited to the first 300. We do run a diversity campaign and we aim for not only 50% participation of men and women in the speaker line-up but attendees. For the last two years, we've achieved a 50% balance in speakers but attendance has been around 30% - 35% women. We will be doubling our efforts this year and extending the programme further.
