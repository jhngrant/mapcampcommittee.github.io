<h2>Call for Proposals</h2>
<p>We are looking for talks on devops, mapping, or serverless but are particularly interested in presentations that incorporate ideas from more than one of these topics. If you can think of a co-presenter you’d be willing to share the stage with then we’d encourage you to submit at least one talk together.</p>
